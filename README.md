# PES Names

This is just a bit of fun really. 

In the old PES games, Konami rarely had the appropriate licences to be able to use the real names of players (particularly in the classic teams). This meant that a lot of the players had curious, often amusing fake names, e.g., 
- BERBATOV = BENBATOV 
- ROBERTO CARLOS = ROBERTO LARCOS
- ROY KEANE = LAW KIT
- CRUYFF = CWARIM
- RONALD KOEMAN = ROMAAL KULTAN

It's unknown what the procedure was for creating these names, so I have made an attempt to mimic this.

Input a name and the program will swap out letters for corresponding options from the char map.

It's not perfect, but good for a laugh!
